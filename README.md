## Mission

Neighborly is designed to help neighbors help neighbors. Request assistance from other neighbors or offer your services and resources free of charge. The hope is that it enables people to replicate the neighborly help that was the norm in the 1950s-1980s before social media - when communities looked out for each other, shared resources freely, and built genuine connections through acts of kindness.

Whether you need help with household tasks, have extra resources to share, or want to offer your skills to those nearby, Neighborly makes it easy to connect with your community and strengthen neighborhood bonds.

## Features

- **Request Help**: Post requests for assistance with anything from household tasks to childcare
- **Offer Services**: Share your skills, time, or resources with neighbors who need them
- **Discover Local Help**: Search for assistance by location, proximity, and type of service
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize requests and offers in your neighborhood
- **Filter & Search**: Find exactly what you need with zipcode lookup, proximity radius, date filters, and type categories
